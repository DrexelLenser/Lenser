`Lenser` is a fast, open-source, minimal-dependency Python tool for estimating weak gravitational lensing signals, particularly flexion, from real survey data or realistically simulated images. `Lenser` employs a hybrid of image moment analysis and an Analytic Image Modeling (AIM) analysis.

## Required Packages
* numpy
* astropy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* pickle
* pandas
* glob
* numdifftools

## Modules

* `lenser_galaxy.py`: Holds a real galaxy image, or a model galaxy image and model parameters
* `lenser_aim.py`: minimizes the parameter space of lenser_galaxy

## Classes and major functions

* `Galaxy` class: 
    * Holds the list of parameters used in the modified S\'{e}rsic model.
    * There are six galaxy shape parameters and (up to) seven lens parameters:
      * `p = {xc,yc,ns,rs,q,phi,psi11,psi12,psi22,psi111,psi112,psi122,psi222}`
    * `Galaxy().generateImage()` function:
      *  Holds the modified S\'{e}rsic model
      *  Points to the `Lens` class and performs the lensing coordinate deprojection
      *  Points to the `Image` class to create a two-dimensional image of the model
      *  Performs PSF convolution if a PSF is available

* `fits_read` function:
    * Reads in FITS file for galaxy postage stamp.   
    * Additionally, looks for FITS files for a noisemap, segmentation map, 
       and PSFmap for the corresponding galaxy.
    * If a noisemap is not provided, `fits_read()` will search for a pickle file at 
       the location `../*noise-info.pkl` that contains information in order to 
       calculate one.
    * If this pickle file does not not exist, then one is calculated based on simple 
       assumptions in `Image()`

* `Image class`:
    * Holds various two-dimensional arrays referred to as "maps"
      * datamap: 
        *  Corresponds to the galaxy image.  
        * Can either by a real galaxy image from a FITS file, read in from `fits_read()`, 
             or it can be a model galaxy image, generated by `Galaxy().generateImage()`
      * noisemap: 
        *  Noise in the galaxy image.  
        *  Can either be a real noisemap from a FITS file, read in from `fits_read()`,
             or, in the absense of a noisemap, `Image()` generates one.
      * psfmap: 
        *  PSF read in from `fits_read()`
        * If one is not provided, PSF convolution is ignored throughout `Lenser`.
    * Holds various two-dimensional arrays referred to as "masks"
      * segmentation mask:
        *  see desciption in `fits_read()`
      * elliptical mask:
        *  Generated so as to include only relevant pixels in the input image, reducing error from sources
             near the edge of the postage stamp. During this process, we also estimate: (i). the background map 
             and (ii). the noisemap, in the case that a noisemap is not already provided and read in through 
             `fits_read()`. The background is then subtraced from the datamap. 


* `Lens` class:
    * Handles the lensing coordinate deprojection
    * Temporarily holds the (up to) seven lens parameters before they are passed into the `Galaxy` class.

* `aimModel` class:
    * Estimates lensing signals from real survey data or realistically simulated images. 
    * The module forward-models second-order lensing effects via calling `lenser_galaxy.py`, convolves with
       a PSF, and minimizes a parameter space. Previous studies on flexion signals have made use of 
       several techniques, including: moment analysis of light distribution, decomposing images 
       into "shaplet" basis sets, and exploring the local potential field through a forward-modeling, 
       parameterized ray tracing known as Analytic Image Modeling (AIM). `Lenser` is intended as a 
       hybrid approach, first using a moment analysis to localize a best-fit lensing model in parameter 
       space and then performing a local minimization on the model parameters in `lenser_galaxy.py`
    * There are six galaxy shape parameters and (up to) seven lens parameters:
      *  `p = {xc,yc,ns,rs,q,phi,psi11,psi12,psi22,psi111,psi112,psi122,psi222}`
    * Recognizing the existence of the shear/ellipticity degeneracy, the default setting of `lenser_aim.py`
        is to set shear to zero (psi,ij = 0) and absorb the degenerate parameters into the intrinsic 
        ellipticity described by q and phi. In the context of smoothed mass-mapping, the inferred shear
        can be used as a prior.  This leaves us with a ten-parameter space given by
      *  `p = {xc,yc,ns,rs,q,phi,psi111,psi112,psi122,psi222}`
    * `lenser_aim.py` estimates brightness moments from an unweighted quadrupole and hexadecapole 
       calculation to be used as an initial guess for the galaxy model. With initialized parameter 
       estimates provided by the measured light moments, the final stage of the lenser_aim pipeline 
       employs a two-step chisquared minimization: (i) first minimizing over the initially coupled 
       sub-space `{ns, rs}` (ii) a final full ten-parameter space local minimization

	
## Examples 

There are a few examples for using `Lenser` provided in the `Lenser/examples/` directory.  There is also a `Lenser/Catalogues/` directory containing five images each from the EFIGI and COSMOS catalogues (for information about these catalogues, see [arXiv:2006.03506](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03506)), along with prep files (contains information about redshift, u-r, etc.), segmentation maps, PSF maps, and noisemaps (noisemaps are provided for COSMOS only, not EFIGI).

* `lenser_run_sim_gal.py`: Simulates a galaxy image and then runs it through `Lenser` 
  * One can use `Lenser` in order to simulate a postage stamp of a galaxy. In this case, the galaxy 
   itself is modeled using the modified S\'{e}rsic-type intensity profile, some sky background `b` is 
   added to the image, and randomly generated noise is added, such that each pixel `i` in the stamp 
   has a value given by:
     `f_i = I_i + n_i âˆ— numpy.random.normal(size=(N1, N2)) + b_i`
   where the noisemap
     `n_i = sqrt(n_{a,i}^2 + (n_{b,i} * sqrt(I_i))^2)`
   where `n_{a,i}` is the sky noise and `n_{b,i} * sqrt(I_i)` is the Poisson noise.
  *  For example, one could create a random Lens of the form
     `myLens = Lens(psi2=[0,0,0],psi3=[0.001,-0.003,0.003,0.0002])`
   to lens some galaxy
     `myGalaxy = Galaxy(xc=0,yc=0,ns=0.75,rs=2.,q=3.5,phi=1*np.pi/6,galaxyLens=myLens)`
  *  This script demonstrates how to simulate such a postage stamp, and then export the datamap and
   noisemap as .FITS files to the working directory.
  *  This script then reads in those .FITS files, generates a mask, finds and subtracts a background,
   and performs a chisquared minimzation using the `aimModel().runLocalMin()` function.
  *  Plots are created for the simulated galaxy image, the elliptical mask, and the noisemap.
  *  A plot is created comparing the simualted galaxy image, the model, and the difference between
   the two.

* `lenser_run_real_gal.py`: Imports a real galaxy image and then runs it through `Lenser` 
  * This script will import an image of a galaxy from one of the catalogues in the catalougues folder.
  * Plots are created for the real galaxy image, the elliptical mask, the noisemap, and the PSF (if provided)
  *  A plot is created comparing the real galaxy image, the model, and the difference between
   the two.


* `lenser_sim_cat.py`: Simulates a catalogue of galaxy images
  * Create a catalogue of simulated galaxy postage stamps using `Lenser`.
  * A number of desired galaxies `Ngal` is specified, galactic and lensing 
   parameters are randomly generated for each galaxy, an image is 
   generated for each galaxy, and the resulting `Ngal` postage stamps are 
   exported to the path 
     `Lenser/examples/Catalogues/Simulated_(insert time)/`

* `lenser_run_cat.py`: Runs an entire catalogue of galaxy images through `Lenser` and exports pickle file of bestfit parameters
  * This script will import one of the Catalogues in the Catalougues folder and run all of the images through `Lenser`.
  * A prep file for a catalogue is required for object identification.
  * Best-fit parameters are dynamically saved in dataframe form to a pickle file.

* `covariance.py`: Calculates a covariance matrix for the `Lenser` parameter space     
  * Since `Lenser` is a forward-modeling code, the user can specify a set of input parameters and 
   create an image of a lensed galaxy. It is, therefore, possible to use `Lenser` in order to 
   compute a covariance matrix for our parameter space by simulating an ensemble of postage 
   stamp images (a "stamp collection") with known input parameters and noise, and 
   then running each of the postage stamps through `Lenser` for fitting. To test the response of 
   `Lenser` to noise, each postage stamp has identical input parameters and noise maps, but 
   additional, unique Gaussian noise injected into each.
  * This module first creates a stamp collection, computes the covariance matrix, and then creates
   a triangle plot of 1- and 2-sigma error ellipses, along with the fiducial parameters indicated
   by a white plus sign.
  * Instances of this class are given in the scripts `covariance_run_COSMOS-like_no_lensing.py`, `covariance_run_EFIGI-like_no_lensing.py`, `covariance_run_COSMOS-like_with_lensing.py`, and `covariance_run_EFIGI-like_with_lensing.py`.
